						9mice loves to break things. He breaks genre boundaries, language barriers, and his computer in the process. He broke our website with his last interview. And now, he’s breaking the news that his upcoming album, 9mm, is dropping soon. “If you’re not surprising your fans, you’re not really an artist,” he says. Who doesn’t love a surprise album?
					</p>
					<br>
					<p align="justify" class="article_container_main_info_text_description">
						From Russian rap to acoustic guitar, 9’s dropping the music that he was scared to drop years ago. He’s growing up — and he wants his fans to grow alongside him. If our servers can handle it, read the interview below, where 9 talks to office about how Sprite, a broken Macbook, and a notoriously bad data recovery system led to his most groundbreaking project to date.

				<p class="speaker"><strong>9MICE —</strong> I’m not gonna lie, with this project, I really did try to escape all my fears of being cringe, so I have so many fucking genres. Like, a few years ago, I’d say, “Oh my god, this guy is just trying everything.” But now, I feel like the more genres you feel comfortable in, the better.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="dialog-entry">
				<p class="speaker"><strong>OFFICE —</strong> It’s not a rap album?</p>
			</div>

			<div class="dialog-entry">
				<p>It’s my very first album where I don’t really have a genre. I have so much personal stuff on the album. I have an ambient song with my mom speaking over it — this whole monologue about how death is not the end, and you don’t need to expect death because you live in the present. There’s a song that’s just me and an acoustic guitar. Years ago, I was so afraid of dropping this type of music.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="dialog-entry">
				<p><strong>And you don’t have anything like that that’s out right now, do you?</strong></p>
			</div>

			<div class="dialog-entry">
				<p>No, I don’t have any music like that on any platforms.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="dialog-entry">
				<p><strong>It sounds like there haven’t even been any leaks or teasers or anything, so this is going to be a total shock to your fans.</strong></p>
			</div>

			<div class="dialog-entry">
				<p>I think so. I didn’t say a word about this project, not even to my friends. So, talking about this project is very exciting for me, because this is one of the first times I’m letting everyone meet the new me without teasing it. They’ll have their own space to explore it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="dialog-entry">
				<p><strong>Wait, are we the ones breaking the news that you’re dropping an album?</strong></p>
			</div>

			<div class="dialog-entry">
				<p>I think so!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="dialog-entry">
				<p><strong>Oh shit.</strong></p>
			</div>

			<div class="dialog-entry">
				<p>It’s so funny — the last time we did an interview, the Office website was down for like, six hours. All my fans were like, “Yo, we want to read this shit, when are they fixing it?” My fans are super crazy. When they see something out, the whole army is there — they need it. I really love them. I’m so thankful for them being so accepting. But at the same time, you can’t rely on the feeling that your fans are going to love everything you share, because that means this race is endless, and you’re just racing yourself. So I’m just excited to drop this project. Maybe some fans are waiting for this project to be a super toxic, high-energy album. I have a few songs like that, but this time, I want to open up the boundaries. I’ve been growing up — I want my fans to grow up with me, too.</p>
